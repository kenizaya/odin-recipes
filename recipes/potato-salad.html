    <p>There are many ways to make potato salad, but if you're looking for a traditional, mayonnaise-based potato salad made with hard-boiled eggs, celery, and a little pickle relish for zing, you've landed on the right recipe.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 potatoes</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped celery</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>½ cup sweet pickle relish</li>
        <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon prepared mustard</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon celery salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, peel and chop.</li>
        <li>While potatoes cook, place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil; cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop.</li>
        <li>Combine the potatoes, eggs, celery, onion, relish, mayonnaise, mustard, garlic salt, celery salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix together well and refrigerate until chilled.</li>
    </ol>
