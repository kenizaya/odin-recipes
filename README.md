## An index of recipes

I got to demonstrate some basic HTML skills with this project, specifically:

- git: add, log, commit, status, push
- HTML tags
- paragraphs
- unordered and ordered lists
- hyperlinks
- adding images to web pages
- difference between relative and absolute paths
- basic CLI commands
